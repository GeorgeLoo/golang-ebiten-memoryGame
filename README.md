# golang-ebiten-memoryGame

Simple memory game written to learn Ebiten game library programming.

https://hajimehoshi.github.io/ebiten/

The goal of this game is to match 
32 pairs of colored squares
in as few tries as possible.
The lowest number of tries is 32.

Works best with mouse.
Right click to go back to the main 
screen at any time.

Please note that on desktop Touchscreens e.g. Surface Pro
can 'rub' a square to click on a square like a mouse.
This is due to lack of support for Touchscreen desktops
on GLFW as of this date 22 Aug 2017.
